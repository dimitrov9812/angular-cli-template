# AngularCliTemplate
This project is a single page app without any complex functionallity. It's purpose only is to represent what I am learning about Angular.


# Structure
 I separate each new thing I learn into it's own div with heading and content
 It looks like this:

* Div

The things I've learned and tried so far:


* Directives in Angular

    * Creating a custom Pipe
* CLI Generating
    * Components
    * Services
